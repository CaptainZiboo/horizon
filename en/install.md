# 🧭 Academy Modpack Installation Guide

Welcome to the **Academy Modpack Installation Guide**!  
This tutorial will walk you through installing **CurseForge**, **downloading the modpack**, and **getting it ready to play**.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Install CurseForge

CurseForge is the official launcher used to easily manage and play Minecraft modpacks.

### 🪄 Installation steps:

1. Go to the official website: [https://www.curseforge.com/download/app](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)
2. Download the version for your operating system:
   - **Windows** → CurseForge for Windows
   - **macOS** → CurseForge for macOS
3. Install the launcher by following the on-screen instructions.
4. Once installed, open CurseForge and sign in with your account (optional but recommended).

💡 _Tip: Make sure you have Minecraft Java Edition installed before continuing._

---

## 📦 2. Download the Modpack

Download the `.zip` file of the modpack below:  
📦 **[Download the Modpack (.zip file)](/modpack.zip)**

> 💾 Save the file on your desktop or in an easy-to-find folder — you’ll need it to import into CurseForge.

---

## 📥 3. Import the Modpack into CurseForge

1. Open **CurseForge**.
2. Select **Minecraft** from the list of games.
3. Click **“Create Custom Profile”** → then **“Import”**.
4. Choose the `.zip` file you downloaded.
5. CurseForge will automatically install all required mods.

Once installation is complete:

- The modpack will appear in your modpack list.
- Click **Play** to launch Minecraft with the modpack.

---

## 🚀 4. Start Your Adventure

- On the first launch, loading might take a bit longer due to mod initialization.
- Make sure to allocate at least **4–6 GB of RAM** to Minecraft  
  _(Settings → Minecraft → Allocated Memory in CurseForge)_.

🧡 That’s it! You’re ready to join the **Academy** and begin your adventure.

## 🔄 5. Updating the Modpack

📅 **Last Update:** February 24, 2026

When a new version of the modpack is released, you have two ways to update it.

### ✅ Recommended Method (Safe Update)

Download the update pack below:  
📦 **[Download the Update Pack (.zip file)](/update.zip)**

1. Extract the `.zip` file.
2. Open your modpack folder:
   - CurseForge → Click the modpack → **Open Folder**
3. Copy the extracted files.
4. Paste them into the modpack folder and **replace files if asked**.

This method keeps your existing configuration and avoids most issues.

---

### ⚠️ Alternative Method (Full Reinstall)

You can reinstall the modpack completely via CurseForge.

However, this method carries **a risk of data loss**, especially:

- World/map data
- Progression on the map
- Local configuration files

If you choose this option, make sure to **backup your `journeymap` folder** before reinstalling.

---

💡 _We strongly recommend using the update pack method to avoid losing progression._

## ❓ Need Help?

If you run into any issues:

- Double-check that you’re using the **correct Minecraft version** (as indicated by the staff).
- Open a ticket in the **Discord Help Center** to get assistance.
