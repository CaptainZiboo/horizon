# 📜 Academy Rules

Welcome to the **Academy**!  
Before starting your adventure, please take a moment to read the following rules.  
They exist to ensure a friendly, respectful, and balanced atmosphere for all players.

## 🏛️ 1. Community Rules (Discord & General)

### 🎭 Respect & Behavior

- Respect for others is **the golden rule**: any toxicity, insults, or aggressive behavior are forbidden.
- Friendly teasing is tolerated **only if everyone involved is comfortable**.
- Harassment or discriminatory remarks (racism, sexism, etc.): **zero tolerance**.  
  _You can joke about everything… but not with everyone._

### 💬 Communication

- No spam, flooding, advertising, or mention abuse.
- NSFW, political, religious, or sensitive content is forbidden.
- Keep discussions in the correct channel (staff will guide if needed).

### 🛡️ Moderation & Sanctions

- Staff reserves the right to intervene at any time to maintain a positive atmosphere.
- Sanctions (warning, mute, kick, ban) will be applied **depending on the severity of the actions**.
- If you believe you were punished unfairly, open a ticket in the **Help Center** to discuss it.

## 🎮 2. Minecraft Server Rules

### 🤝 In-Game Respect

- Just like on Discord, respect between players is **mandatory**.
- No griefing, stealing, or destroying others’ builds.
- PvP is forbidden **unless both players consent** or in official events/tournaments.

### ⚒️ Server Usage

- Any attempt to cheat, duplicate, glitch, or use unauthorized client modifications is forbidden.
- Report any bugs via the **Help Center**.
- Please avoid overloading chunks (machines, spawners, etc.) to maintain good server performance.

## 🌍 3. Gameplay Rules

### 🧰 Special Blocks & Structures

- **PCs, healing machines, and waystones** are essential for everyone.  
  → It is **strictly forbidden** to break or loot them.
- Every player should be able to progress at their own pace without being penalized.

### 🌾 Farms & Resources

- **Farms and pastures** are not limited per player or team.
- **Automated farms** are forbidden to preserve server performance and balance.
- Avoid overexploiting the same area (ores, natural resources).

### 🏠 Bases & Structures

- **Generated structures** (Pokémon centers, villages, etc.) can be used temporarily.
- You cannot establish a **permanent base** there: build your own living spaces!

### 🪓 World Respect

- No griefing: don’t destroy other players’ builds.
- No floating trees, dangerous holes, or abandoned structures.
- **Community projects** (roads, public buildings, shared areas) must be respected.

### ⚔️ Player Interactions

- **Wild PvP** is forbidden: only allowed if both players agree or during events.
- **Rare/legendary Pokémon** belong to the player who spotted them first.
- Trades between players must be **fair and honest**. Scamming is forbidden.

### 🌐 Balance & Performance

- No massive redstone or machine systems that could harm server performance.
- **Mob farms** must remain reasonable.
- Any use of glitches or duplication is strictly forbidden.

⚖️ _By joining the server, you agree to respect these rules and help maintain a friendly, immersive, and welcoming atmosphere._
