# 📜 Academy Rules

Welcome to the **Academy**!  
Before starting your adventure, please read these rules carefully.  
They exist to ensure a friendly, respectful, and balanced environment for all players.

## 🏛️ 1. Community Rules (Discord & General)

### Respect and Behavior

- Respect is **the golden rule**: no toxicity, insults, or aggressive behavior.
- Jokes are fine **only if everyone involved agrees**.
- Harassment or discriminatory remarks (racism, sexism, etc.) are met with **zero tolerance**.

### Communication

- No spam, flooding, advertising, or excessive mentions.
- NSFW, political, religious, or sensitive content is forbidden.
- Keep discussions in the appropriate channels.

### Moderation and Sanctions

- Staff may intervene at any time to maintain a positive atmosphere.
- Sanctions (warning, mute, kick, ban) depend **on the severity of the actions**.
- If you believe you were punished unfairly, open a ticket in the **Help Center**.

## 🎮 2. Minecraft Server Rules

### In-Game Respect

- Respect between players is **mandatory**, as on Discord.
- No griefing, stealing, or intentional destruction of others’ builds.
- PvP is forbidden **unless both players consent** or during official events.

### Server Usage

- Cheating, duplication, glitches, or unauthorized client modifications are forbidden.
- Report bugs through the **Help Center**.
- Avoid overloading chunks (machines, spawners, etc.) to keep the server stable.

## 🌍 3. Gameplay Rules

### Special Blocks and Structures

- **PCs, healing machines, and waystones** are essential for everyone: **do not break or loot them**.
- Every player should be able to progress at their own pace.

### Farms and Resources

- **Farms and pastures** are not limited per player or team.
- **Automated farms** are forbidden to maintain balance and performance.
- Avoid overexploiting the same area (ores, natural resources).

### Bases and Builds

- **Generated structures** (villages, Pokémon centers, etc.) can be used temporarily.
- You may not establish a **permanent base** there — build your own space.

### World Respect

- No griefing or destroying others’ builds.
- Avoid floating trees, dangerous holes, or abandoned structures.
- **Community projects** (roads, public zones, shared builds) must be respected.

### Player Interactions

- **Wild PvP** is forbidden: only allowed by mutual consent or during events.
- **Rare/legendary Pokémon** belong to the player who spotted them first.
- Trades must be **fair and honest**. Scamming is not allowed.

### Balance and Performance

- Avoid massive redstone or machine systems that harm performance.
- **Mob farms** must remain reasonable.
- Any use of glitches, duplication, or cheats is strictly forbidden.
